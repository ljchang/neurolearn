Design\nMatrices follow a data organization format common in many machine learning\napplications such as the sci-kit learn API: 2d tables organized as observations\nby features. In the context of neuro-imaging this often translates to TRs by\nconditions of interest + nuisance covariates (1st level analysis), or\nparticipants by conditions/groups (2nd level analysis).\n"
